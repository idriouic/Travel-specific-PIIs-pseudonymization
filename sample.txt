    Subject: Complaint Regarding Flight disruption and request to compensate 

    Dear Delta Airlines,

    I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the disruption of flight DL1234 on August 10, 2023,. The disruption was announced just two hours before the scheduled departure time, leaving many passengers stranded.

    Below are the relevant details for my booking:
    - PNR: RFAKP8 - E-ticket: 006-9876543210
    - Passenger Name: John Doe
    - Flight Number: DL1234
    - Aircraft Registration: N835DN (Boeing 737-900ER)
    - ICAO Aircraft Type: B739
    - Departure Airport: JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport)


    I had important business meetings scheduled upon my arrival, and this disruption caused significant inconvenience. I would like to request compensation as per EU Regulation 261/2004 since I was rebooked on flight DL5678 the next day, arriving over 24 hours later than originally planned.

    Please treat this complaint with urgency and respect for my privacy. You may reach me at my contact details below for any updates:
    - Phone: +1 555-123-4567
    - Email: johndoe@businessmail.com

    Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

    Sincerely,2
    John Doe
